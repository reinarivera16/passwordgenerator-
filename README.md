# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Task

A task was given to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Criteria

```

```
